# CODEOWNERS file defines individuals or teams that are
# responsible for code in a repository.
# See: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence, they will
# be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
