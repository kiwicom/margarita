# Margarita
> Showcasing the power of [Tequila](https://partners.kiwi.com/presenting-tequila-revolution-travel-industry/)

This project is a living example of a client app you could start building with Tequila.

## Installing / Getting started

To get started, clone the repository, change directory and install the dependencies:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kiwicom/margarita.git
cd margarita/
yarn install
```
To launch the graphql server:
- `yarn server`

To launch the client app, you have different options:
- `yarn dev` to launch the _development_ web version;
- `yarn build; yarn start` to launch the _production_ web version;
- `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to start the mobile version.

The other available scripts are:
- `yarn analyze` to get an analysis of the bundle size to get the following

- `yarn lint` to ensure your code is properly formatted;
- `yarn flow` to ensure your code is respecting the types given to your vaiables;
- `yarn test-ci` to ensure your code should pass the Continuous Integration (CI) tests;
- `yarn relay` to get the latest schema of the [graphql server](packages/graphql)
and compile your queries and fragments to generate Flow types, among other things.

[Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and the mobile version is powered by
[Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo).

> NOTE: Note this is only meant as an example app and even though we take
pride in the quality of our work, features should not be assumed to be
