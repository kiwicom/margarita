If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

_NOTE: Note this is only meant as an example app and even though we take
pride in the quality of our work, features should not be assumed to be
production-ready._

To ensure code quality, make sure to run `yarn test-ci` and fix the potential
errors before pushing your code. See [above](./getting-started#available-scripts) for a description of what it does.
