Margarita is heavily inspired by our <a href="http://kiwi.com" target="_blank">Kiwi.com</a> mobile and web apps. We want to create a full-fledged production ready app for developers, entrepreneurs and companies who want to use our API.

## Supported Features

Margarita is split into 4 parts or functional domains:

- [Search for connections](features#search-for-connections)
- [Booking](features#booking)
- [Manage my booking](features#manage-my-booking)
- [Payments](features#payments)

### Search for connections

#### Search form

- The initial screen of the whole app. The user can set here all the options about the connection he is looking for, such as the departure date, the place of origin, etc.
