## Developing

### Considerations

This project follows `react-native-web`'s philosophy of ["Write Once, Render Anywhere"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWM2uhv2wI). The web version is powered by
[Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and the mobile version is powered by
[Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo).
