Summary: 
# Summary: <longer description, documenting the history of the repository>
# e.g. Summary: For Icon component to work on web, it was necessary to add dependency on @kiwicom/orbit-components. Since mobile version relies on a font file, it should be possible to use the font on the web as well. Created issue to improve this in the future.
